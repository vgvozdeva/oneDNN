Build from Source {#dev_guide_build}
====================================
You can build and install the oneDNN library using the source distribution.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that all [software dependencies](https://github.com/uxlfoundation/oneDNN#requirements-for-building-from-source)
are in place and have at least the minimal supported version.

## Step 1. Download the Source Code

Download [oneDNN source code](https://github.com/uxlfoundation/oneDNN/archive/main.zip)
or clone [the repository](https://github.com/uxlfoundation/oneDNN.git).

~~~sh
git clone https://github.com/uxlfoundation/oneDNN.git
cd oneDNN
~~~

## Step 2. Build the Library

You can quickly get started with building the library.

The general steps involved in building the library are as follows:

1. Set up the environment for the compiler

   Configure your operating system's
   environment variables to point to the compiler's location.

2. Generate the build system

   The oneDNN build system is based on [CMake](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake.1.html).
   Use the following command to generate a build system:
   ~~~sh
   mkdir -p build ; cd build
   cmake .. [<options>]
   ~~~
   @note You can use `cmake -B <path-to-build> [-S <path-to-source>] [<options>]` to specify the following:
   - `-B <path-to-build>`: Specify the path where the build files will be generated.
   - `-S <path-to-source>`: Specify the path to the source directory containing the source files, dependencies, compiler options etc.


   The following are a few useful options defined by CMake:

   - `-G <generator-name>` to specify build system generator (e.g. `"Visual Studio 17 2022"`,
    `Ninja`, `"Unix Makefiles"`).

   - `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path>` to control the library installation location.

   - `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<build-type>` to select between build type (`Release`, `Debug`,
    `RelWithDebInfo`).

   - `-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<path>` to specify directories to be searched for the
    dependencies located at non-standard locations.

   See @ref dev_guide_build_options for detailed description of build-time
   configuration options defined by oneDNN.

3. Build the library

   CMake provides a unified method for building a project, independent of the
   generator or operating system used.

   Multi-threaded compilation is recommended for a faster build process.
   Use the `--parallel` option to specify the number of parallel jobs.

   ~~~sh
   cmake --build <path-to-build> --parallel <jobs> [<options>]
   ~~~
   Full list of options can be found [here](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake.1.html#build-a-project).

You can build the library on Linux, macOS, or Windows using the compiler of your choice.

### Build on Linux and macOS

#### Use GCC, Clang, or Intel oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler

1. Set up the environment for the compiler
   ~~~sh
   # Uncomment the following lines to build with GCC
   # export CC=gcc
   # export CXX=g++

   # Uncomment the following lines to build with Clang
   # export CC=clang
   # export CXX=clang++

   # Uncomment the following lines to build with Intel oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler (x64 only)
   # export CC=icx
   # export CXX=icpx
   ~~~

2. Generate the build system
   ~~~sh
   mkdir -p build ; cd build
   cmake ..
   ~~~

3. Build the library

   **For Linux:**
   ~~~sh
   cmake --build . --parallel $(nproc)
   ~~~

   **For macOS:**
   ~~~sh
   cmake --build . --parallel $(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)
   ~~~

#### Use Intel oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler with SYCL runtime

1. Set up the environment for the compiler

   Intel oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler uses the `setvars.sh` script to set all the
   required variables. The command below assumes you installed the compiler to the default
   folder. If you customized the installation folder, `setvars.sh` (Linux/macOS)
   is in your custom folder.
   ~~~sh
   source /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh

   # Set Intel oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler as default C and C++ compilers
   export CC=icx
   export CXX=icpx
   ~~~

2. Generate the build system
   ~~~sh
   mkdir -p build ; cd build
   cmake .. -DONEDNN_CPU_RUNTIME=SYCL \
            -DONEDNN_GPU_RUNTIME=SYCL
   ~~~

   @note Open-source version of oneAPI DPC++ Compiler does not have the icx driver,
   use clang/clang++ instead. Open-source version of oneAPI DPC++ Compiler may not
   contain OpenCL runtime. In this case, you can use `OPENCLROOT` CMake option or
   environment variable of the same name to specify path to the OpenCL runtime if
   it is installed in a custom location.

3. Build the library

   **For Linux:**
   ~~~sh
   cmake --build . --parallel $(nproc)
   ~~~

   **For macOS:**
   ~~~sh
   cmake --build . --parallel $(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)
   ~~~

#### Use GCC targeting AArch64 on x64 host

1. Set up the environment for the compiler
   ~~~sh
   export CC=aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc
   export CXX=aarch64-linux-gnu-g++
   ~~~

2. Generate the build system
   ~~~sh
   mkdir -p build ; cd build
   cmake .. -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME=Linux \
         -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR=AARCH64 \
         -DCMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/aarch64-linux-gnu/lib
   ~~~

3. Build the library

   **For Linux:**
   ~~~sh
   cmake --build . --parallel $(nproc)
   ~~~

   **For macOS:**
   ~~~sh
   cmake --build . --parallel $(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)
   ~~~

#### Use GCC with Arm Compute Library (ACL) on AArch64 host

1. Set up the environment for the compiler

   Download [Arm Compute Library](https://github.com/ARM-software/ComputeLibrary)
   or build it from source and set `ACL_ROOT_DIR` to directory where it is
   installed.
   ~~~sh
   export ACL_ROOT_DIR=<path/to/ComputeLibrary>
   export CC=gcc
   export CXX=g++
   ~~~

2. Generate the build system
   ~~~sh
   mkdir -p build ; cd build
   cmake .. -DONEDNN_AARCH64_USE_ACL=ON
   ~~~

3. Build the library

   **For Linux:**
   ~~~sh
   cmake --build . --parallel $(nproc)
   ~~~

   **For macOS:**
   ~~~sh
   cmake --build . --parallel $(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)
   ~~~

### Build on Windows

#### Use Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler

1. Set up the environment for the compiler

   Microsoft Visual Studio uses the `VsDevCmd.bat` script to set all
   required variables. The command below assumes you installed to the default
   folder. If you customized the installation folder, `VsDevCmd.bat` is in your
   custom folder.
   ~~~bat
   "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Professional\ ^
    Common7\Tools\VsDevCmd.bat" ^
   -startdir=none ^
   -arch=x64 ^
   -host_arch=x64
   ~~~
   or open `x64 Native Tools Command Prompt` from start menu instead.

2. Generate the build system
   ~~~bat
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 17 2022"
   ~~~

3. Build the library
   ~~~bat
   cmake --build . --config=Release --parallel %NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS%
   ~~~

@note Currently, the oneDNN build system has limited support for multi-config
generators. Build configuration is based on the `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` option
(`Release` by default), and CMake must be rerun from scratch every time
the build type changes to apply the new build configuration. You can choose
a specific build type with the `--config` option (the solution file supports
both `Debug` and `Release` builds), but it must refer to the same build type
(`Release`, `Debug`, etc.) as selected with the `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` option.

@note Alternatively, you can open `oneDNN.sln` to build the project from the
Microsoft Visual Studio IDE.

#### Use Intel oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler with SYCL Runtime

1. Set up the environment for the compiler

   Intel oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler uses the `setvars.bat` script to set all
   required variables. The command below assumes you installed to the default
   folder. If you customized the installation folder, `setvars.bat` is in your
   custom folder.
   ~~~bat
   "C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat"
   :: Set Intel oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler as default C and C++ compilers
   set CC=icx
   set CXX=icx
   ~~~
   or open `Intel oneAPI Command Prompt` from start menu instead.

2. Generate the build system
   ~~~bat
   mkdir build
   cd build

   cmake .. -G Ninja ^
         -DONEDNN_CPU_RUNTIME=SYCL ^
         -DONEDNN_GPU_RUNTIME=SYCL
   ~~~

   @warning Intel oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler on Windows requires CMake v3.23 or later.

   @warning Intel oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler does not support CMake's Microsoft Visual
   Studio generator.

   @note Open-source version of oneAPI DPC++ Compiler does not have the icx driver,
   use clang/clang++ instead. Open-source version of oneAPI DPC++ Compiler may not
   contain OpenCL runtime. In this case, you can use `OPENCLROOT` CMake option or
   environment variable of the same name to specify path to the OpenCL runtime if
   it is installed in a custom location.

3. Build the library
   ~~~bat
   cmake --build . --parallel %NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS%
   ~~~

## Step 3. (Optional) Validate the Build

After building the library, you can run a predefined test set using:

~~~sh
ctest
~~~
The [`ONEDNN_TEST_SET`](https://uxlfoundation.github.io/oneDNN/dev_guide_build_options.html#onednn-test-set)
build option set during the build configuration determines the scope
and depth of the test set. Useful values are `SMOKE` (smallest set), `CI`
(default), and `NIGHTLY` (most comprehensive). The test set can be reconfigured
after the entire project has been built, and only the missing tests will be
compiled.
~~~sh
cmake .. -DONEDNN_TEST_SET=NIGHTLY
cmake --build .
ctest
~~~
ctest supports filtering the test set by using the `-R` option. For example,
to run only the GPU tests, use:
~~~sh
ctest -R gpu
~~~
Another useful option is `--output-on-failure`, which will print verbose output
in case a test fails. Full set of options can be found [here](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html).

@warning
When using the `/opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh` script from the Intel oneAPI Base Toolkit,
the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable is set to include the oneDNN library path.
Make sure that the correct oneDNN library is present in
`LD_LIBRARY_PATH` by setting it explicitly, if needed.

## Step 4. (Optional) Build Documentation

1. Install the requirements
   ~~~sh
   conda env create -f ../doc/environment.yml
   conda activate onednn-doc
   ~~~

2. Build the documentation
   ~~~sh
   cmake --build . --target doc
   ~~~

## Step 5. Install the Library

Install the library, headers, and documentation.

The install directory is specified by the [CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.html)
CMake variable. When installing in the default directory, you need to run the following command
with administrative privileges using `sudo` on Linux/macOS or a
command prompt run as administrator on Windows.

~~~sh
cmake --build . --target install
~~~
